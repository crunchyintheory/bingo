Bingo board

Encode your tiles with base64, each tile on one line:

```
Tile1
Tile2
...
Tile24
```

`?q=TEXT_AS_BASE64`

`&free=FREE_SPACE`

A random board will be generated, but seeding boards is supported. To seed, add `&seed=NUMBER`. You can also copy the current seed from within the app (recommended).
